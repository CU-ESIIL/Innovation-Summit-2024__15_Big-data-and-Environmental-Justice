# Group 15 -- Advancing Data Equity for Environmental Justice

# Research question: What data equity model and accountability practices advance environmental justice?

### Group Members (alpha order): Jeff Altschul, Nels Bjarke, Jess Logan, Nathan Morrow, Maddy Nyblade, Queen Quet

### Data Sets:

- NSF grant amounts
- Government Estimates (Federal and State)
- Comanagement 
- Policies of Government Agencies in relation to environmental justice and interaction with communities
- Justice 40 data
- Community engagment contracts 
- Southern Environmental Law Center
- Bullard CEnter for Environmental Justice
- HBCUs
- Existing data sets: Data needs to be extracted, re-framed and strengthened. Put into a model of what needs to be left at the end of the project so the data can still be used in the community it came from.

# Day  Report Back

### What worked well for your team?
- Organic way we used our strengths
- Talked in a circular manner
- Working face to face is powerful - distance and zoom would change the dynamic

### What's one thing you would change?
- Don’t change anything after the first day

### Did your group have an Ah-Ha Moment? What led up to that moment?
- Individual Ah-Ha's as we shared around our circle. 
- Nel’s graph

### Did your group experience the Groan Zone?
- The ESIIL structure for this topic doesn't fit.
- This space does not have the tools, people, or culture to support this topic yet. 
- If ESIIL seriously wants to tackle the topic of environmental justice and equity in data, then partner with the Bullard Center <https://www.bullardcenter.org/>

### One tip to share with future groups about getting through the groan zone
- Sit in a circle and dicuss around the circle
