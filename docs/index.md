### What’s missing: what resources, people, data sets, etc. does your team need?
1. Data
- Data sets are not appropriate for what is needed. They need more EJ community participation.
- How the data is created, stored, and structure needs to be looked at and improved for EJ data. Consider how to be equitable with the data and not exploit the group it is collecting from.
- Apply the [Principles of Environmental Justice](https://ejnet.org/ej/principles.pdf) to the data structure. 
- Empower local and/or marginalized groups to manage their destiny or environmental resources. We need to marshal information that demonstrates if you do that (empower) you get to a better outcome so not just a “good thing” or “morally right”, its scientifically the right thing to do for society at large.

2. Culture of Environmental Justice
   
4. People
   

### What are you thinking about doing next with your team? Long-term, short-term?
- Personal Connections
- Long Term - The group has decided it is an important topic. If truly interested in doing the research in it, it would require teasing it out over a longer period of time. Everybody has a different perspective - figure out what is the best approaches to effect change and the process in a positive way. It’s beyond writing an academic paper - its coming up with a new system of making decisions in multiple fields (environmental and political arena).

### Data Sets:

- NSF grant amounts
- Government Estimates (Federal and State)
- Comanagement 
- Policies of Government Agencies in relation to environmental justice and interaction with communities
- Justice 40 data
- Community engagment contracts 
- Southern Environmental Law Center
- Bullard CEnter for Environmental Justice
- HBCUs
- Existing data sets: Data needs to be extracted, re-framed and strengthened. Put into a model of what needs to be left at the end of the project so the data can still be used in the community it came from.

# Day 2 Report Back

### What worked well for your team?
- Organic way we used our strengths
- Talked in a circular manner
- Working face to face is powerful - distance and zoom would change the dynamic

### What's one thing you would change?
- Don’t change anything after the first day

### Did your group have an Ah-Ha Moment? What led up to that moment?
- Individual Ah-Ha's as we shared around our circle. 
- Nel’s graphs

### Did your group experience the Groan Zone?
- The ESIIL structure for this topic doesn't fit.
- This space does not have the tools, people, or culture to support this topic yet. 
- If ESIIL seriously wants to tackle the topic of environmental justice and equity in data, then partner with the Bullard Center <https://www.bullardcenter.org/>

### One tip to share with future groups about getting through the groan zone
- Sit in a circle and dicuss around the circle
